\subsubsection{Task 2.c.} 
We plan to implement a Taint Analysis Framework that integrates the ideas developed in Tasks 2a and 2b. 
%
This framework will be implemented in OCaml.
%
The framework will support both static taint tracking which prevents undefined behavior (from Task 2a) and dynamic monitoring (from Task 2b).
%
We plan to use the implemented framework to evaluate the performance, e.g., execution time and resource utilization, of our proposed approaches. 
% 
We will use the AES encryption algorithm as a benchmark.
%
We anticipate that using a static footprint analysis in the dynamic monitor will enable better performance compared to prior taint tracking systems, as it will help reduce unnecessary runtime calculations.
