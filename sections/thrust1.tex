\subsection{Motivating Example}
AES encryption algorithm. Each GPU thread encrypts a 16-byte block independently.
The algorithm does the exact same thing to each block.
\subsection{Task 1.a.} What we have developed so far with Godha.
With focus on bank conflicts, but general enough to all sorts of costs.
Explain the type system.
Relational Hoare Logic
Logical relation

\subsection{Task 1.b.} Quantitative aspect.
Min entropy.
Such theories offer an attractive way to relax the standard noninterference properties, letting us tolerate “small” leaks that are necessary in practice. 

\subsection{Task 1.c} Implementation of the type system.
Formalizing the proofs.
